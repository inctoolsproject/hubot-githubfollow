# Hubot githubfollow

Hubot script for follow github repos and get notifications.

Embrional phase, hope to publish it to npm soon.

It was in JS and I flash ported in coffee so it's really ugly :smile:

##Things to do:##
- [ ] Implement unfollow
- [ ] Use brain(now is all in memory)
- [ ] Implement unit test

Any help is welcome
