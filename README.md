# Hubot githubfollow

Hubot script for follow github repos and get notifications.

Embrional phase, hope to publish it to npm soon.

It was in JS and I flash ported in coffee so it's really ugly :smile:


## Installation

Run `npm install --save hubot-githubfollow`

Add **hubot-githubfollow** to your `external-scripts.json`:


## Things to do:
- [ ] Implement unfollow
- [ ] Use brain(now is all in memory)
- [ ] Implement unit test

Any help is welcome
